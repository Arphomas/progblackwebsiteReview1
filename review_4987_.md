# Interest of Content
There are some interesting topics presented but only a small amount of information to go with each one.

# Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
Some styling isn't consistent between pages. For example, the quiz on the education page has a different style to the quiz on the sustainability page. Pages do not seem to contain links to the original page, which would be quite annoying because one may not be accessing a page from the front page, and thus wouldn't be able to use the back buttons in their web browser.

# Quality of Written Presentation
For each topic, there is a short summary followed by a "Continue reading..." link that doesn't go anywhere. Additionally, the healthcare page does not contain any information at all and instead just contains a default template, so there isn't anything to talk about there.

# Validity of HTML
While this technically isn't invalid HTML, there are a lot of links throughout the website that don't actually work, and instead will just take you to the top of the page. In particular, the "Continue reading..." links don't work.

# Evidence of Collaboration
There is sufficient evidence of collaboration, since the author of a page is written at the bottom of each page along with a link to their GitHub and LinkedIn pages. There is also a single location on the front page there is a list of authors, although this list does not contain any links to each author's GitHub
